## 🚀 The Vision: Beyond a "Chatbot"

Building a startup is hard. You have an amazing vision, but reality requires validation, brutal honesty, engineering planning, and go-to-market strategies. 

**UltraNova** operates as your **second brain for business**. 
You don't just chat with it—you pitch it. In return, a simulated boardroom of specialized AI Agents dissects your idea from multiple angles, catches mistakes before they happen, and delivers extreme, actionable clarity.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Boardroom-Style Multi-Agent Architecture
When you input a concept, a squad of independent AI personas go to work:
- 🧠 **Strategy:** Validates the core idea and analyzes market sizing.
- 🛠️ **Product:** Structures the MVP, defines the tech stack, and charts the roadmap.
- 📈 **Growth:** Maps out Go-To-Market strategies, ad campaigns, and content generation.
- ⚙️ **Operations:** Handles the heavy lifting of resource allocation and hiring plans.
- ⚖️ **The "Hard Truth" Engine:** Gets real with you. It actively looks for flaws and delivers an unfiltered reality check with a specific "Confidence Score".

### 2. Dual-Mode Cognitive UI System
Unlike typical applications with a simple color-swapped light/dark toggle, UltraNova executes two radically different, highly-engineered aesthetic modes based on your workflow state:

#### 🌙 **Cosmic Dark Mode (The "Executive" State)**
- Deep space atmospheric backgrounds (`#0A0A0F`) layered with frosted glassmorphism elements.
- Features a sweeping, dynamic 3D Particle Canvas simulating stars, cosmic nebulae, and high-end networking.
- Highlighted by our signature brand colors: *Nova Purple*, *Quantum Blue*, and *Growth Green* neon glows.

#### ☀️ **Neo-Brutalist Light Mode (The "Architect" State)**
- A hardcore, elite B2B design language inspired by structural wireframes and industrial design.
- Features sharp borders, crisp `#ffffff` backgrounds, flat cast-shadows, and high-contrast typography.
- **The Agent Neural Network**: A custom-engineered, state-of-the-art HTML5 Canvas simulation running actively in the background. It draws live mathematical data connections between nodes that actively repel and interact with your mouse cursor while streaming brand-colored data pulses.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend (`/ultranova-next`)
- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router, React server components) built on Turbopack for supreme speed.
- **Styling:** Modular CSS Variables, Tailwind CSS integration, and heavily customized keyframe animations for breathtaking visual feedback.
- **Graphics/Interactivity:** Native WebGL & HTML5 Canvas API driving continuous background simulation physics.
- **Component Architecture:** Pure React primitives with advanced `IntersectionObserver` scroll-reveals and context-based theming.

### Backend (`/ultranova-backend`)
- **Framework:** Python + FastAPI for asynchronous, blazing-fast API resolution.
- **AI Core:** Leverages advanced LLM routing logic to simulate the separate expert Agents securely and accurately.
- **Data Validation:** Strict Pydantic models ensuring all "Agent Boardroom" outputs are safely structured into JSON for the frontend to render.

## ⚙️ Getting Started (Local Development)

To run UltraNova locally, you will need to boot up both the UI and the API.

### 1. Start the API Engine
1. Navigate into the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ultranova-backend
   ```
2. Setup a virtual environment and install requirements:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### 2. Start the Frontend OS
1. Open a new terminal and navigate into the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ultranova-next
   ```
2. Install the necessary Node packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Visit `http://localhost:3000`** in your browser. Be sure to hit the physical Sun/Moon toggle switch in the navigation bar to experience the custom Canvas physics engines associated with both Dark and Light modes!
